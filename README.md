# Image-Encryption-using-Cellular-Automata-Draft


This project, created for our 4th year sems, is an attempt to encrypt data using a combination of rules including cellular automata, sbox and other chaotic systems. It is purely based on python and has been tested to work within very light system requirements. In addition to encryption it also features a storage system for containing the encrypted data, that is also encrypted.
The project offers three options: 
1. Plain Text encryption
2. Image encrption
3. Signature encryption

All of these methods have been tested and have shown very satisfactory entropy in the resulting encrypted data, making it very hard for attackers to decrypt said data without keys. And of keys, it offers two: A public key and a private key.


Requirements:

1. Python 3 and above
